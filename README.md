# glumpnet-jekyll

Glump.net site/blog implemented in Jekyll. This is my own personal project to port my web site to Jekyll; you are welcome to look at my code/data, but I will not provide any support at this time.

In the future I might create Jekyll plugins and external code to implement features not handled by Jekyll and hopefully I will package those as standalone repositories separate from this one.
